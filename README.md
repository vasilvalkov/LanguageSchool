Language School is a standard web ASP.NET MVC application for Linguana - a school for foreign languages. All visitors can access and read info for the school, articles, available courses and other public data. 
Registered users can enroll in available courses and can see info about current and past enrolled courses. Also, they have access to their profile info.
A registered user who is granted administrative rights has acces to the administration view which enables them to edit all the data in the system, e.g. to change course or user details, add or delete course or user and so on.
